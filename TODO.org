#+title: Todo

* DONE Phase 0: Create a Dummy Worker Program
** Should be able to control when it crashes and when it doesn't

* DONE Phase 1: Persistent Child
** Program takes commands and args as input
** Program must launch child
** Program blocks and waits while the child process runs
** If child exits successfully, the program also exits
** If the child fails, the program tries again

* DONE Phase 2: Black Box
** Program catches all outputs from child
** Program places all the output in a specific log file with time stamps

* DONE Phase 3: Circuit Breaker
** Program must detect if child is in a crash loop
** If child is in crash loop, restart delays should increase exponentially

* DONE Phase 4: Puppet Master
** Program must respond to User signals (kill)
** Must properly handle memory when receiving signal

* HOLD Phase 5: Dynamic Configuration
** Takes user input from files instead of hardcoded values
* DONE Phase 6: Create event driven poll to minimize CPU usage
* TODO Phase 7: Enforce limits on the child
** Use setrlimit to set memory limits for the child
** Maybe set CPU usage limits as well
** Kill child if it uses more memory than allocated.
* TODO Clean up code
** Create methods for each client call
** Create method to print time to log.txt
**** Add all client/server data to log.txt

* Phase 8: Create config file
